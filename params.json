The portion of the\r\ncode-base that can be easily translated over is the diagnosis subset --the\r\nsection of code that can analyze a topology and assign optimal ancestral states\r\nto internal nodes under different optimality criterion. Anyone can develop a\r\nsearch heuristic mechanism around this. Of course, designing one that is\r\nexpandable and encompasses 90% of users demands is another story. This document\r\ntalks about the design decisions to diagnose a topology, obtaining a score,\r\nrecovering states, modifying the topology (break, join, re-root, fuse, and\r\ndealing with a forest) and optimizing those states on the topology to reduce the\r\noverall score.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
