(** This module provides the mechanisms to perform data-alignments of any type
    based on a minimal module of details. Included are a number of alignment
    algorithms, their properties are constrained by creating the [mem] type of
    each in particular ways. For example, setting minimum and maximum Ukkonen
    barriers is provided on a specific function of obtaining the [mem] type in
    the Ukkonen module. *)
