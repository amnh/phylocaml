        <h1>phylocaml</h1>

<p>A Phylogenetic Library based on a refactoring of POY (code.google.com/p/poy).</p>

<p>We've thought a lot about how to develop a library from what we have and the
experience we have gathered from our work on POY3/4/5. The portion of the
code-base that can be easily translated over is the diagnosis subset --the
section of code that can analyze a topology and assign optimal ancestral states
to internal nodes under different optimality criterion. Anyone can develop a
search heuristic mechanism around this. Of course, designing one that is
expandable and encompasses 90% of users demands is another story. This document
talks about the design decisions to diagnose a topology, obtaining a score,
recovering states, modifying the topology (break, join, re-root, fuse, and
dealing with a forest) and optimizing those states on the topology to reduce the
overall score.</p>
